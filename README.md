# Secondary-Testosterone-Deficiency-Prediction-using-ML-Classifier

This is my final year project.

Here the attached documents are:
1. Presentation PPT
2. Report
3. Base Paper of Project

Exisitng:
  
  In existing system multiple classifiers and multiple samplings are used. using all these upto 80% of average accuracy is predicted. For medical analysis we need above 95% to get correct result. 
  
Proposed:
  
  In proposed system XgBoost Classifier is used to predict deficiency. This classifier achieves 96% of average accuracy.
